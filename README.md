Electric Vehicle Population Analysis Application
This full-stack application offers a comprehensive platform for analyzing electric vehicle (EV) populations. It leverages a powerful backend built with Flask to handle data processing, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning model executions. The frontend, crafted with React, provides an intuitive user interface for interacting with the backend services, enabling users to load data, clean it, perform EDA, and run various predictive models.

Features
Data Loading: Users can upload EV data files for analysis.
Data Cleaning: Provides functionalities to clean the uploaded data, including handling missing values and removing unnecessary columns.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Supports various EDA techniques to understand the underlying patterns in the EV data.
Model Execution: Users can select and execute machine learning models on the processed data to predict outcomes or classify data points.
